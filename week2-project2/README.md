## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app, I struggle with ensuring the grid and the container box of the card, which I mean I lack of css skills. Especailly on the 
card flip animation I want to be flip and I needed to be do some research on how to do it. Working with CSS is not something easy I need more practice on it more.
